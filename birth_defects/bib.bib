	abstract = {The projection of mortality rates requires inter alia close examination of the mortality experienceof a population overa long periodof time and will usually also involvethe analysis of mortality trends by cause of death. In two of the more important recent contributions, techniques were devised for explaining change in life expectancy in terms of mortality changes in particularage groups and by different causes of death. The approaches adopted by the authors differ, and the purpose of this article is to reconcile the two and tie the results in with those obtained by earlier writers. A new method for explaining the change in a life expectancy differential in terms of the observed changes in the mortality differentials and the observed change in overall mortality level is also described.},

	abstract = {This article integrates two methods that analyze the implications of various causes of death for life expectancy. One of the methods attributes changes in life expectancy to various causes of death; the other method examines the effect of removing deaths from a particular cause on life expectancy. This integration is accomplished by new formulas that make clearer the interactions among causes of death in determining life expectancy. We apply our approach to changes in life expectancy in the United States between 1970 and 2000. We demonstrate, and explain analytically, the paradox that cancer is responsible for more years of life lost in 2000 than in 1970 despite the fact that declines in cancer mortality contributed to advances in life expectancy between 1970 and 2000.},

	abstract = {Congenital anomalies (CAs) contribute significantly to under-5-years child mortality (U5M) throughout the world. This study analyzed trends in the CA-specific U5M rate in urban and rural China. This population-based epidemiologic study used data obtained by China’s National U5M Surveillance System from 1996 to 2013. Data from national surveillance sites were used to examine CA-specific U5M rates by year, urban and rural habitation, and sex. Mixed effect negative binomial regression models were used to assess the trends in CA-specific U5M rates and differences in those trends between urban and rural areas. The CA-specific U5M rate decreased from 407.7 per 100,000 live births in 1996 to 217.4 per 100,000 live births in 2013, with average annual decline rates of 6.4\% (95\% CI=5.6\%, 7.1\%) and 3.8\% (95\% CI=3.3\%, 4.3\%) in urban and rural areas, respectively. The CA-specific U5M rate was the same in both rural and urban areas in 1996, but the U5M rate of the rural areas was 1.621-fold of that of urban areas in 2013. In urban and rural China, cardiovascular anomalies were the most frequent CAs, accounting for 50.3\% and 58.2\% of U5M due to CA, respectively. CAs have become one of the leading causes of U5M in both urban and rural China and the difference between the CA-specific U5M rates in two areas is gradually increasing. Reduction of child mortality due to CAs and elimination of the geographic disparity in child mortality rates should be major public health concerns in China.},
